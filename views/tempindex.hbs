        <h2>Neuromancer</h2>
        <h3>William Gibson</h3>
        <p>Case was twenty-four. At twenty-two, he'd been a cowboy, a rustler, one of the best in the Sprawl.
          He'd been trained by the best, by McCoy Pauley and Bobby Quine, legends in the biz. He'd operated on
          an almost permanent adrenaline high, a byproduct of youth and proficiency, jacked into a custom
          cyberspace deck hat projected his disembodied consciousness into the consensual hallucination that
           was the matrix. A their, he'd worked for other, wealthier thieves, employers who provided the exotic
           software required to penetrate the bright walls of corporate systems, opening windows into rich
           fields of data.</p>
        <p>He's made the classic mistake, the one he's sworn he'd never make. He stole from his employers. He
          kept something for himself and tried to move it through a fence in Amsterdam. He still wasn't sure
          how he'd been discovered, not that it mattered now. He'd expected to die, then but they only smiled.
          Of course he was welcome, they told him, welcome to the money. And he was going to need it.
          Because--still smiling--they were going to make sure he never worked again.</p>
        <p>They damaged his nervous system with a wartime Russian mycotoxin.</p>
        <p>Strapped to a bed in a Memphis hotel, his talent burning out micron by micron, he hallucinated for
          thirty hours.</p>
        <p>The damage was minute, subtle, and utterly effective.</p>
        <p>For Case, who'd lived for the bodiless exultation of cyberspace, it was the Fall. In the bars he'd
          frequented as a cowboy hotshot, the elite stance involved a certain relaxed contempt for the flesh.
          The body was meat. Case fell into the prison of his own flesh. </p>
